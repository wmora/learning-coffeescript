Learning CoffeeScript
=====================

These files show the basics of CoffeeScript.


To compile/run:
coffee -o js -c coffee/filename.coffee
node js/filename.js


Or you could test a single file (without its extension) by running:
./test_script.sh filename


To compile all files at once just run:
$ ./compile_all.sh

Or run:
$ coffee -o js -c coffee/*.coffee
